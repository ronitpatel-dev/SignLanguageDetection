Introduction

Communication plays a vital role in our daily lives. For individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, sign language serves as a powerful means of expression. However, since not everyone understands sign language, it often creates communication barriers in common environments such as schools, hospitals, and public spaces.

With advancements in technology—particularly in computer vision and deep learning—we can now teach machines to interpret visual cues like hand gestures. This project, SignLanguageDetection, aims to recognize hand gestures used in sign language. The ultimate goal is to help bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers, promoting inclusivity and accessibility for all.
